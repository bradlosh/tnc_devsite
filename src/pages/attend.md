## Sunday 10:25am | Wednesday 7pm

_Find your best life._

At True North Church, you will find powerful worship, empowering Biblical teaching and a community dedicated to pursuing the presence of God. Our aim is to meet you where you are and to help you find your best life. You can get there from here.

***

### Nursery

Available during Sunday services. Our babies receive lots of love, prayers & individual attention!

To request more information or to get in touch our nursery staff, please contact info@truenorth.sc.

### Planet Faith Children's Ministry

Available during Sunday and Wednesday services after praise & worship. By the time kids graduate from Planet Faith to youth, we want them ready to tackle middle school as strong believers. We have three big ideas:

1. Every kid know how to read and understand the Bible for themselves.
2. Each has hands-on experience serving God.
3. Every kid knows that being a Christian is fun!

### Encounter Youth Ministry

Bridging the journey from childhood to adulthood, our mission is to prepare young people to walk with God for a lifetime. Youth have monthly meetings to help them connect with other young people at church.

### Adult Ministry

Our worship and teaching emphasize the Word and the Spirit. At TNC, you will find a place of belonging, the opportunity to develop and put your gifts to work. No matter what life has dealt you, God has a plan and purpose for you. You will be changed by the Spirit of God, grow in the Word of God and be a witness in the world of the power of God to save, heal and deliver. Only in Him will you find your best life!
